# Scrape out two pieces of info from the consituency elections from 2006:
# https://www.elections.org.zm/media/parliamentary_results_2006.pdf
# 1. overall poll stats (how many people voted, registered)
# 2. candidate/election results

# known errors ------------------------------------------------------------
# * Totals from Nakonde constituency are screwed up. Total counted by constituency breakdown is greater than the turnout
#   line item from the constituency total.  Crossreferencing with pdf shows that the constituency total does not include
#   the winner of the constituency, so it's short 11,935 votes.
#   Assume: number of rejected ballots and registered is correct.
#   Assume: cast = cast + 11935; vote_count = vote_count + 11935
#   ** MANUALLY CORRECTED **
# * Ignores data from Lupososhi and Kabompo East constituencies; both had elections delayed till 2006-10-26 b/c of deaths and aren't reported.


# setup -------------------------------------------------------------------
# # taken care of in ZMB_E01_helpers.R
# library(rvest)
# library(stringr)

# library(tidyr)


# goals -------------------------------------------------------------------
# [0] Convert pdf to something usable using Tabula; scrape assembly data from Excel workbook
# [1] Pull the turnout by constituency --> as06_total
# [2] Pull out the votes by candidate by constituency --> as06




# Import data ---------------------------------------------------
as06_raw = read_csv(paste0(base_dir, 'rawdata/tabula-2006_parliamentary_results.csv'))


# [0] â€” get the data frame into a workable format -------------------------

# unfortunately, there are some frame shifts that make things a bit onboxious.
# luckily, there are only two possible frame shifts. 
# 1) chunk where col1 = prov, col2 = dist, col3 = constit, col4 = candid, col5 = party, 
#                col6 = vote_count, col7 = rejected, col8 = cast, col9 = registered, col10 = NA
# 2) chunk where col1 = NA, col2 = prov, col3 = dist, col4 = constit, col5 = candid, col6 = party, 
#                col7 = vote_count, col8 = rejected, col9 = cast, col10 = registered

# Approach:
# 1. filter out the column labels: col1 | col 2 = 'PROVINCE'; everything is NA; col8 | col9 = 'CAST', col9 != 'TOTAL'
# 2. Find where the constituency is: col3 or col4 (which is the first row in a chunk)
# 3. Fill down the shiftFlag down the rest of the chunk, till you hit the next constituency
# 4. Create new cols where the data are consistent.
# 5. Fill down prov, dist, constit
# 6. Clean up strings: prov, dist, constit, candidates
# 7. Convert strings to numbers: vote_count, rejected, registered, cast
# 8. Merging to geo_base not required, since already have prov + dist
# 9. Tag as total and separate totals by candidate and totals by constituency
# 10. calc pcts.
